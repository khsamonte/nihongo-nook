## Background

Hi. I'm a 30 year-old full-time programmer from the Philippines and I started studying Japanese exactly one year ago (April 30th, 2023) when I attended my first online class in a language school. Prior to that, I had been learning on Duolingo at a very relaxed pace, so I knew how to read Hiragana (and Katakana). I am presently bilingual with Tagalog as my native language and a C2-level of proficiency in English.

## Timeline

### Japanese Classes

During my first five months, my studies primarily consisted of:

+ ・N5 classes on the weekends (3 hours on Sat/Sun)
+ ・Vocabulary + grammar drills on my free time
+ ・Rote Kanji writing

This was my regular routine for the whole duration of my N5 classes. I was happy with my learning pace. I began to feel the difficulties of Japanese when we started learning about the plain form of the verbs (-ru, -nai, -ta, -nakatta) halfway through the course. I remember thinking, "Life was so easy with the -masu forms, why am I suddenly bombarded with this info overload?!"

When we were given our first Listening Quiz, which only started around August (the 4th month of the class), I didn't understand a single thing. This admittedly made a dent to my morale and humbled me down quickly. I was confident with my basic reading skills, but my listening comprehension was nonexistent. I started easing in some listening reviews to my studies, but it was very difficult to comprehend everything the first time.

Overall, I was satisfied with this class, and I became good friends with some of my classmates. Although the downside to it is that it'll take a very long time to learn the language at the pace we were going, the classes were very fun and friendly to keep us motivated.

When our classes ended on September, I immediately enrolled for N4 classes (even though my N5 exam was still in December). The grammar lessons were relatively easy, but I felt a steep curve in difficulty with the reading exercises. Almost always, whenever we were having reading quizzes and exams, I was last to finish amongst the class. Everyone else was significantly faster than me.

Because of this, I dreaded the reading comprehension tests. It felt like sludging through uninteresting material, primarily because majority of the vocabulary went over my head. I once scored 2/7 on a reading test after giving it my all, and while that was very quickly demoralizing, my tolerance for failure is thankfully pretty good. To compensate for this, I adapted stricter vocabulary and Kanji drills.

### JLPT N5

I took my JLPT N5 exam on December 3rd, 2023 and attained the following scores:

+ ・Total Score: 110 / 180 (61.1%)
+ ・Vocabulary/Grammar + Reading: 79 / 120 (65.8%)
+ ・Listening: 31 / 60 (51.7%)
+ ・Percentile Rank: 80.5

I understand that some people think the JLPT is a waste of time, e.g. one's proficiency is hardly defined by tests with flawed designs. Nonetheless, there is a sense of fulfillment and anticipation in these tests, and that is enough for me (also, attaining an N2 level opens you up to a wide variety of professional jobs in Japan.)

### Immersion

At the start of 2024, I started hearing about immersion and comprehensible input (i + 1). I became aware of [AJATT (All Japanese All The Time)](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html) methods, which discarded traditional textbook-learning and endorsed single-handedly relying on immersion (i.e. reading and listening to Japanese content) to learn a language, paired with building your own flashcard deck on Anki, which utilizes [SRS]() (I use the [FSRS algorithm](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki) with a 90% retention rate). However, I don't rigorously subscribe to their extreme methods because it requires a good level of linguistic intuition (which I don't have) and I am fully aware that the amount of intensity they demand will burn me out.

My listening practice started with [レイラさん]() on the recommendation of my girlfriend. Her content is really good for beginners as she speaks slowly and repeats words while delving in relatable everyday topics. Every day, I spent weeks listening to her while walking and taking the train on my way home from work.

I was lucky that my favorite anime, [青春豚野郎](), is heavily dialogue-driven (the episodes consist of 95% conversations). I began manually transcribing the Japanese subtitles from Netflix straight to Google Docs, analyzing every single sentence, and adding all the vocab I didn't know to my flashcard deck. I extracted and trimmed the audio using Audacity, transfered the audio file to my phone, and repeatedly listened to it over and over and over (at least 20 times and counting).

This was a game-changer for me. This specific method single-handedly enhanced my listening comprehension 10x. I love transcribing in general; it's the kind of labor I'm willing to grind hours and hours (whole weekends) on. Then I did the exact same thing for the 2nd Episode of Bunny Girl Senpai. My daily 2.5 hours of commute was primarily spent on listening to these audio files. Before I sleep, I would also listen with my eyes closed until I finally feel sleepy.

After doing this for two episodes, I was suddenly _quite_ comfortable with indulging on Japanese content (with Japanese subtitles) virtually everywhere else (anime, YouTube, etc.). Of course, I still didn't fully understand the content I was watching, but I had a rough idea of what was going on most of the time. This is the first time I understood the sweet spot of immersing in i+1 content (comprehensible input). I devoured as many Japanese media as I could. Some of my favorites are: [あかね的日本語教室](), [Speaking Japanese Naturally](), and [Japanese with Naoko]().

> Side Note: I was late to discover [Language Reactor](), which gives you the power to export entire Japanese transcripts from Netflix and YouTube (including auto-generated subs). Also, it's a tool that allows you to check definitions of words on the subtitles as you watch along Japanese shows. This tool has been invaluable to my learning.

Moreover, reading the transcripts was made easy with the existence of hover-dictionaries like [Yomitan (PC)]() and [10ten (iOS)](). Having the audio available for these transcripts facilitiates reading comprehension. I utilized my programming skills by writing Python scripts to automate raw transcripts in the format I wanted and hosting an unindexed site (using JavaScript and markdown) to easily access my transcripts with the hover-dictionaries.

Here is my current immersion method:

+ １）I watch a whole anime episode/YouTube video with Japanese subtitles (minimal to no pauses).
+ ２）Using torrent and converters, I strip the audio of the episode/video, trim out the unnecessary parts using audio software, and export the refined audio file to my phone. I will listen to this audio as many times as possible during my free time.
+ ３）Using Language Reactor, I'll generate the transcript from the subtitles and use it for my extensive reading. I will study each line and sentence intensively by looking up the definition of each new word I encounter and try to make sense of the sentence using context. For each word I don't know, I will add one flashcard to my Anki deck. Then I will read the transcript over and over as many times as possible.

This method is definitely not going to be effective for everyone in the same way AJATT did not work for me. But this process works for me because 1) I enjoy the whole laborious process and 2) I have a _very low_ tolerance for ambiguity (i.e., I prefer to fully understand all the vocab and grammar in a transcript).

I cannot emphasize this enough: my methods are very personal to me, and this is what I find highly effective to do continuously and consistently. If you have a rough idea on how you would like to proceed with your study methods (whether it be Duolingo, language school, AJATT, Kanji writing, etc.), I highly encourage you to do that and follow your heart.

My point is - my immersion methods bring me a tremendous amount of joy, and I strongly believe that the best way to learn a language is to have fun with how you learn, no matter how personalized your methods are. It's okay if you don't know yet which works for you - it took me a whole year to figure this out after reading so many articles on the internet. 

### Cure Dolly's Organic Japanese

In addition, I discovered [Organic Japanese with Cure Dolly](), which is arguably the best online lesson structure existing to get a crystal-clear understanding of Japanese grammatical foundations. The reason for this is because it teaches Japanese grammar and its nuances the Japanese way, without the external influence of any other language and culture. (For instance, some school textbooks were obviously written in the context of English (and even Filipino) subtleties.)

Cure Dolly's lessons, along with my daily flashcard reps, serve only as a supplemental aid to my immersion, which is always my primary method of study.

## Present

### Current routine:

+ ・Dedicating most of my free time to consuming Japanese content _repetitively_. 
+ ・Eliminated Kanji rote writing from my routine altogether. Writing is effective for some people - I'm just not one of them. I find mnemonics to be more effective, but I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it.
+ ・Active listening immersion during 2.5 hours of commute and passive listening at work.
+ ・Occasionally chatting and talking in Japanese to my partner (she is N2-level).
+ ・Finishing my daily Anki flashcards in the morning. My card format is: Kanji in front, reading/meaning/audio/sentence at the back.

### An honest rating of my present skills:

+ １）Reading: **A2**. I can't read light novels smoothly yet, but I am comfortable with reading extensive passages in N4-level reading comprehension tests.
+ ２）Listening: **A2**. I can understand what's going on most of the time in simple conversations and monologues, but I might miss some of the vocab occasionally.
+ ３）Writing (typing): **A2**. I can hold a conversation with my girlfriend with a bit of mental effort. I may be able to write a letter to a friend.
+ ４）Speaking: **A1**. It takes me a long while to form simple, descriptive sentences.

## Takeaways

・Language schools can give you a rough framework on how to start and continue with your studies, and a hundred hours of language school grants you a Student Visa eligibility, but its pedagogical efficacy differs from person-to-person. The possibility of losing motivation after attaining low scores, vocab drills without sentence context, and the way in which some of the grammatical foundations is taught were some of my major issues. They are a rich source of learning material and resources for your own studies, however.

・There is such a thing as over-reliance on Google Translate. I highly recommend trying to analyze more complex sentences on your own first, with Google Translate only serving as a last resort.

・Aside from obvious nouns like "dog" and "vending machine", Japanese words have a life of their own and cannot be completely defined by their closest English translation. The word 面白い (omoshiroi) means "funny", but it also means "interesting". Some words don't even have direct translations; they can only be grasped by the context in which they are used.

・You don't always have to immerse in material with comprehensible input (i+1). Sometimes, you can listen to something way more challenging above your current level. The important thing is you are _enjoying the material_ enough for you to listen to it over and over and over.

・Technology has immensely facilitated the study of languages, and we are very fortunate to be living in modern times.

## Resources

+ For reading, I use Yomitan on PC, 10ten on my iPad, and Immersion Reader for ebooks. I obtain subtitles using Language Reactor on Netflix and YouTube. Japanese anime subtitles are also readily available on  ____.

## Future Plans

・**Start reading novels.** As someone who voraciously reads English content and heavily prefers ebooks over audioboks, reading Japanese content presently bores me to no end. I am not as enthusiastic when it comes to reading materials as I am when listening to audio material while reading the transcript/subtitles. But I cannot deny the effectiveness and importance of reading: I've read posts about [people who were conversationally fluent but much less lliterate](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1c53bk2/actually_living_in_japan_but_illiterate_and/) and [people who were much more literate than they are conversationally fluent](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1c47cvt/actually_going_to_japan_made_me_realize_id_rather/). For my second year, I plan to indulge on light novels from start to finish and then listen to their respective audiobooks repeatedly.

・**Start practicing output.** Tagalog is my native language, but I grew up being exposed to English media. I was already heavy into writing short stories before I started reading books when I was young, but it took me several years to be as good in speaking the language as I am in writing. I initially thought my level of fluency in English was unattainable, especially speaking-wise. With Japanese, it feels the same: I can hold a conversation through chat, but my speaking skills are far inferior. I might post about my methods next year once I figure them out.

・**My ultimate goal is C1 level: conversational fluency and university-level literacy.** I have no delusions that it will take me a very long time to attain this - five years or more, at the very least. It may even take me an entire lifetime. Language learning is tough, but I am pleased with my current progress.
