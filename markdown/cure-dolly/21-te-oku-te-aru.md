こんにちは。

Today, we're going to go back to Alice's adventures, and we're going to use them as an opportunity to look into some of the deeper and more subtle uses of the て-form.

These are covered in the regular textbooks and Japanese learning websites, but as usual they don't explain the logic behind them, which makes them more difficult to grasp. And in some cases where there isn't a straightforward English equivalent they really don't tell you what's actually going on, because they only talk in terms of English equivalents, which leaves you guessing quite a bit of the time.

So, if you remember, Alice was falling very slowly down the rabbit hole and she had taken a jar off one of the shelves as she fell.

"そのびんにはラベルが貼ってあって 「オレンジ・マーマレード」と書いてあった”

So we have three て-formed verbs in this sentence. Let's look at what they're doing.

"そのびんにはラベルが貼ってあって." 

+ ・"びん/瓶" is the word being used for a "jar" here. It can mean "bottle" – it's often translated as "bottle" – but it can also mean a "jar" and that's what it means here.
+ ・"ラベル" means "label". It's "ラベル" and not "レベル", I believe, because it comes from another European language other than English. Note: レベル means “level”. We can also say "レーベル", but that's less common than "ラベル". (The ー is important here)
+ ・"貼る" means "stick" or "paste" something onto something else, so this means that a label was pasted onto the bottle.

```
"そのびんにはラベルが貼ってあって。" 

・その：that
・びんに：jar-on
・は：topic
・ラベルが：label
・貼って：pasted-
・あって：-was-and
```

Literally, speaking of that bottle as the target of something, a label was pasted onto it.

Now this use, "貼ってある", we haven't covered in this course up to now.

We've talked about て-form of a verb plus "いる", and we know that "いる" means "be" and て-form of a verb plus "いる" means to be-doing that verb or to be-in-a-state of that verb.

---

### てある

What about "-てある"?

"ある" also means "be", so the meaning is in fact very similar. It also means to be-in-a-state of that verb. However, there is a difference, and I'm going to explain that difference with another example.

Let's take the sentence "窓が開いている" and the sentence "窓が開けてある".

```
窓が開いている

・窓が：window
・開いて：open
・いる：is

窓が開けてある

・窓が：window
・開けて：opened
・ある：is
```

Both of them mean "The window is open".

"開いている" simply means that the window is open, and we can translate that directly into
English, and it's really the same thing.

But "窓が開けてある" doesn't have any English equivalent because it still means the window is open but it carries another implication.

```
～ている - can refer to ongoing actions or states
窓が開いている

・窓が：window
・開いて：open - verb can be self-move or other-move
・いる：is

～てある - can only refer to states (caused by actions)
窓が開けてある

・窓が：window
・開けて：opened - verb can only be other-move (the action is from outside)
・ある：is
```

First of all, we are using the other-move version of "開く", which is "開ける" (bottom one).

"窓が開いている" – that's the self-move version of "開く" and it simply means to be open, to exist in a state of openness.

The other-move verb, "開ける", which is the regular く / ける う-ending verb to え-stem + -る of the third law of self-move/other-move verbs that we've looked at already. (Lesson 15) So...

+ ・"開く" (the one up) means be open yourself, whatever you are, a box or whatever;
+ ・"開ける" (the one down) means open the box, open the door etc.

So what "窓が開けてある" means is that the window was open, but it was open because somebody else opened it. We're signalling that in the first place by using the other-move version of the verb and in the second place by using "ある" instead of "いる".

```
～ている - can refer to ongoing actions or states
窓が開いている

・窓が：window
・開いて：open - verb can be self-move or other-move
・いる：is - Inanimate objects are honorary "willed beings". State is "their own"

～てある - can only refer to states (caused by actions)
窓が開けてある

・窓が：window
・開けて：opened - verb can only be other-move (the action is from outside)
・ある：is - Objects are fully inanimate. State caused externally.
```

So what's the reasoning behind that?

Well, when we say "窓が開いている", although it is an inanimate object, we're using the version of "be" which we use for animate beings, people and animals and such. That in fact is the part that needs explaining, isn't it?

Why are we using the animate version of "be" for an inanimate object like a window? And we do this all the time. We're always saying "-ている" for inanimate objects of all kinds.

The reason is that in this expression we're simply saying the window was open – we're not implying that anybody opened the window. So, in a way, we can say that we're treating the window as an honorary animate being.

The window was open, as it were, of its own volition. We're not saying it's open because of anybody's will other than its own. So in a certain sense we are treating the window as an honorary animate being: "窓が開いている".

But if we say "窓が開けてある", we are saying that somebody opened the window. The window was the mere object of having been opened by somebody else. So it loses its status as an honorary animate being. It is treated as a mere object, an inanimate thing – "開けてある".

And the thing to understand here is that even though it's lost its status as an animate being, even though we're using the other-move version of the verb, the が-marked actor of this sentence is the window: "窓が開けてある".

The window is doing the action, which is "ある": the window is existing in a state of having been opened by somebody else. And that is the same thing that's happening in our sentence from Alice.

"そのびんにはラベルが貼ってあって" –

"The jar existed in a state of having had a label pasted (onto it) and…"

Now, as you see, there is really nothing equivalent to this in English, so we just need to get it into our minds so that we can look at the Japanese as Japanese.

This is fundamental to what I'm teaching here. I'm teaching the real structure of Japanese, not simply throwing some Japanese at you and throwing some English at you and saying, "Well, this kind of means that." We need to get rid of English translation as far as possible and look at the Japanese as it really works in itself as Japanese.

And that's why my "translations" under the trains get weirder and weirder. Because I'm not trying to translate this for you into natural English. I'm trying to tell you what the Japanese is really doing.

So the second half of the sentence...

The second て-form (あって), of course, is simply joining the first logical clause in this compound sentence to the second logical clause.

```
そのびんにはラベルが貼ってあって「オレンジ・マーマレード」と書いてあった。

・その：that
・びんに：jar-on
・は：topic
・ラベルが：label
・貼って：pasted-
・あって：-was-and
・オレンジ・マーマレードと：orange marmalade
・書いて：written-
・あった：-was

Unusual が substitution
と replaces が indictating quotation.
Possible with 書いてある because the thing quoted is also the actor

In ラベルが貼ってあって, the label is the A-car (the actor or grammatical subject)
In 0と書いてある, the quotation itself is the A-car.
```

And the second logical clause is "「オレンジ・マーマレード」と書いてあった".

And here we have again this "-てある" form. And whenever we talk about something being written on something we tend to use this form. We don't say "The label said 'Orange Marmalade''', which is what we say in English, as if the label could speak.

We say "「オレンジ・マーマレード」と書いてあった". -と is our quotation particle, of course, that's quoting exactly what was written on the label, and then "書いてある" means that it was in a state of having had those words written on it by somebody else.

Now, I'm going to do something a tiny bit unusual here. I hope you won't mind.

I'm going to skip ahead just a little bit in the story, because the next part contains a very interesting point that really needs a lesson of its own, and the part immediately after that includes something that really rounds out what we're doing today.

---

### ておく

It introduces "-ておく", which really belongs together with "-ている" and "-てある".

This relationship is something the textbooks don't explain, and because they don't, it leaves "-ておく" rather undefined in people's minds. Many quite advanced students don't really understand why "-ておく" is used in some cases. So we'll go ahead with that now and I'll just fill you in on the story in between. It's only a little bit.

Alice realizes that the marmalade jar is in fact empty, and what's she going to do with it? She doesn't want to drop it because it'll fall all the way down the hole and very likely kill someone. And, if you read the newspapers, you're probably aware that there are far too many empty marmalade jar incidents in Wonderland already.

So, now you know the background, let's carry on.

"うまく戸棚の一つへ通りすがりに置いておいた"

+ "うまく" means "skilfully";
+ "とだな/戸棚" as we know is a "cupboard";
+ "戸棚の一つ", as we talked about in the last lesson (Lesson ??), is "one of the cupboards".

So she skilfully in passing put it into one of the cupboards.

And what's this "置いておいた"?

Now, they're both the same "置く", "置く" meaning to "put".

The first one is simple enough: she "put" it into the cupboard, but why do we have the second "おく" at the end of it – "置いておいた"?

Now, this is another very common and very important て-form usage and it's one that the textbooks and English-language websites tend not to explain very well, because it's something we really don't have in English. However, we already halfway know it, because it is in a certain sense the other half of "-てある".

```
窓を開けておく - "Put action in place" of opening window so that it will remain in state of openness.

窓が開けてある - Exist in state of openness put in place by someone's action.
```

**"-ておく" means to put the action in place.**

Now in this particular use, it's quite easy to see because she's putting the jar literally into place and she's putting that action into place. What the textbooks and websites tell you is that it means doing something in advance, doing something for the purpose of something else. And this is true in many cases. It's probably the nearest you can get in English.

But **what it actually means is putting the action in place.** And to understand this let's go back to our example "窓が開けてある" – "the window is open because somebody opened it".

Now, the somebody who opened it, if we say it instead of from the point of view of the window, from the point of view of the person doing the action, 👇 "開けておく" is the other side of this.

The person put the opening of the window into place so that thereafter the window would be open.

So you see we have the two halves of the same coin.

+ "窓が開けてある" – the window stands open because somebody put it there.
+ "窓を開けておく" – open a window so that it will stand open for the future, so that it will then be open, put into place the action of opening the window.

And this is what "おく" means – "おく" means "place".

So you're "placing" the action, you're putting it into place, you're setting it up. And that's why it tends to have the secondary meaning of "do in advance" or "do for another purpose", because you are setting up that action and the implication is that you want the effect of that action to "remain in place" for whatever future purposes it may have.

In this case, Alice does not have a future purpose.

So in fact, て-form plus "おく" has a much wider range of meaning than the "do in advance" or "do for a purpose" kind of English translation that it gets in the textbooks.

In the case of Alice in this story, she isn't really doing anything in advance or for a purpose; she's simply trying to solve the problem of what to do with the empty marmalade jar without risking injuring the people below.

And there are many cases when this usage falls even further from the English-language definitions.

For example, people say, "It's cruel to lock (up) a small child in her room", and for this we use "閉じ込めておく".

"閉じ込める" is "shut someone up/lock someone away" and the "-ておく" here doesn't mean do it for a purpose, it doesn't mean do it in advance.

It means do the action and leave its results in place/put the action in place and leave it in effect.

Similarly, people say, "It's all right to leave a baby to cry sometimes" – "泣かせておく".

"泣く" is "cry"; "泣かせる" is the causative of cry: "allow to cry" in this case. (Lesson 19)

And the "-ておく" doesn't mean do it in advance or do it for some special purpose. It simply means do the action and leave its effects in place/put the action in place.

Note: This can be a bit tricky (judging also by the sheer amount of concentrated underlining, (btw. let me know if it is hard to read), so I recommend also checking the comments, as usual.

### Comments

> @CureDolly (on ておく vs てある):
> 
> 〜ておく and 〜てある are indeed related. But the important thing to understand is that they are *the opposite sides of the same coin* - they are not the same side so it is important not to confuse them. Let me explain.
> 
> 〜てある is, a *stative* verbal expression. This means that it expresses a state, not an action (this is always true of ある). And the state that it expresses is the *state resulting from the equivalent ておく expression*.
>
> So if I say まどをあけておく I am saying that I open the window and leave it that way (put the action in place). If you say まどがあいてある - you are talking about the window that I opened and left open.
>
> まどをあいとある is ungrammatical because を marks the thing acted upon by the が-marked subject of the sentence (the A-car). But with あいてある the subject of the sentence is not acting upon anything. It is in a *state of having been acted upon* itself.
>
> Does this make it clear?

> @CureDolly (on readers' and learners' translations):
> 
> Yes, the distinction between readers' translations and learners' translations is very important. If you are actually translating an anime or manga for the general public "I like coffee" is correct and translating receptive sentences into the English passive is also correct in a large number of cases - "correct" meaning making the characters use natural English and say something close to what the original text said. Of course how far one should go in making Japanese characters talk as if they were American characters is a creative decision. To some extent it is inevitable - and it is interesting to see that two different translations are rarely the same. In more extreme cases a character is almost remolded to be more like who she would be if she had been born in America.
> 
> But that is really a whole different point. I am always surprised by how textbooks etc. present these loose translations to learners as if they were what the words were actually saying. It is really so unhelpful and sows problems that just get deeper as they go along.
> 
> The thing about よろしくお願いします is that it isn't regular Japanese grammar. It is a kind of keigo (ultra-polite Japanese) called kenjougo (humble-speech) and the grammatical formation of the sentence is a little different from regular grammar. It isn't difficult and I probably will map it with trains some time, but probably not until we get to learning some keigo. But to summarize what is going on if you are interested, in kenjougo instead of using a verb straight out as in normal Japanese we first use the honorific "o", then the verb in its い-stem form (making it a noun) and then suru to turn it back into a verb again! The verb here is negau, wish, or beg and yoroshiku is the adverbial form of yoroshii, good (a slightly fancier form of ii or yoi) in its ku adjectival form. So in all it means something like "(treat me) well, (I) humbly entreat" - and it is kind of old-fashioned like that, except that it is so often used that it doesn't feel old fashioned - just as "Good bye" = God be (with you) doesn't feel old-fashioned in English because it's just a part of everyday speech.
> 
> I would recommend learners not to worry too much about keigo (there are two other forms as well as kenjougo, all used together) - even Japanese people can have trouble with it. The heroine in Fruits Basket uses keigo all the time and gets it wrong all the time (a part of her character that I imagine can't help getting lost in translation!) No one will ever expect you to use it (unless you work for a Japanese company). People in customer service situations will use it toward you and you will encounter it in anime etc, so we do need to cover it when we have the basics firm, but luckily it is much easier to understand than to use correctly. It isn't really that difficult to use but it will take a few lessons to get a handle on it. And we'll definitely do that!

> @CureDolly (on 上 vs 中):
> 
> That's a very good question.. The text just says  へ, which is a little unusual being the "direction" rather than the strict "target" particle (though they overlap considerably), probably because she was passing by and had to reach toward it rather than calmly place it (this is also implied by うまく, since there is no skill in just putting something on or in a cupboard under normal circumstances). So essentially I would say that we don't know for sure. It is very possible to specify either とだなの中に or とだなの上に. One could argue that since putting something on top of a cupboard is unusual and nothing was specified one should assume the normal action. On the other hand that would have involved opening the cupboard in passing, putting in the jar, and ideally closing it again. Was she falling slowly enough for that? I think we have to conclude that the text doesn't tell us.

@CureDolly (on 々):

> I actually wrote about this in my book Alice in Kanji Land - Alice calls it "ten-ten-hooking" and sees the ten-ten (the double-mark that turns an unvoiced consonant into its voiced equivalent) as a little double-hook that attaches a word to the word that comes before it. I did say a little bit about it in one of the videos too. I have noticed that the concept of voiced vs unvoiced consonants is difficult for some people (they don't see how k/g, t/d etc are related) though for most people they are easy to teach by just getting them to say the sounds in isolation and notice what is happening (presence and absence of vocal chord engagement). I have actually done a few pronunciation-based videos of that sort too (like the one on small tsu https://youtu.be/qsOMQf5MxrQ ) though I have to say that when I make a video about anything except pure grammar structure the videos get far less views, so I'll likely sandwich it into a grammar video. Really it isn't much different structurally from the way English often doubles letters when extending words (hot→hotter, job→jobbing, etc.) except that it is more concerned with joining two words into a compound concept and it does affect the pronunciation, but in an absolutely regular way. So regular that it can be done to form new words ad hoc with full understanding. For example, when my little sister Kinoko was staying in Japan her host family (who know her well and are on familiar terms) referred to her little room not as kinoko no heya (Kinoko's room) but as kinokobeya (the mushroom-room). Kinokobeya is not an established Japanese word but it is easily formed by ten-ten-hooking (rendaku) and sounds instantly understandable and kawaii.

@CureDolly (on てしまう):

> Te-shimau isn't really related here, I think. It has a variety of uses, not really easy to encapsulate (and is very often used in the truncated form ちゃう, especially in the past tense). A good analogy in English, at least for the past tense form (which gives a handle on the rest) is the expression "done" as in "the dog done ate my dinner". This is used in many very similar circumstances to 〜てしまいました・〜てしまった・ちゃった (the past form of 〜てしまう in descending order of formality). So we very often say things like  忘れちゃった: "I done forgot". As with "done" it very often expresses something negative, sometimes something unexpected with usually at least one of those two elements present. For example non-negatively we can say "I done won the lottery!" which works equally well with ちゃった. Since しまう really means "close" the same notion of stressing the fact that it has actually been done (for better or worse, believe it or not, etc,) applies. The main difference is that しまう is not restricted to the past tense and already-accomplished facts. So you can say things like "I'll done get fat" (太ってしまう) which of course is impossible in English.
>
> Incidentally しまった used on its own and often likened to a dirty word in English (there's nothing dirty about it but some English speakers would unfortunately use a dirty word in the circumstances where it is used) means something like "that's done it" in the bad sense. It refers to a turn of events which has brought about a final "closed" result of a bad kind - from breaking a plate to missing a train.

@CureDolly (on double particles):

> Thank you! This is the plain location-marking use of に telling us where the marked noun is (in this case on the label is on the bottle. The addition of は makes it a topic and therefore adds slight emphasis to the label "as for on the bottle" - which gives an emphasis pattern slightly (but not so strongly) like "what was on that bottle? A label was on that bottle". If you find "double particles" confusing you may want to watch this video https://youtu.be/iPiLVZoYhfM 
>
> If you find the subtler qualities of は confusing I should say that this is a slightly advanced question that you will get used to over time. It is a bit difficult for English (and non-Japanese generally) learners as most languages don't have topic-marking. If you want to go into this at this stage I have a pair of videos that explain it more:
>
> https://youtu.be/_nXHpkTTfGs
>
> https://youtu.be/o-hK4-qv9Yk
>
> The second one is about the implications of は as in this sentence (and many others) but it would be best to watch the first one first to get the concepts on which the second one is based. But if you don't want to go that deep at this stage don't worry! The reason I don't talk about it in these early lessons is because easier to take on when you have more experience.

@CureDolly (on "why and when structures are used"):

> This sort of thing can't really be learned in the abstract. It is good to know the structure, but the "why and when it would be used" question is has only one answer: immersion, immersion, immersion. You don't get the "feel" of a language from abstract explanations.

@CureDolly (on なく):

> This なく is not a word in itself. It is the negative helper adjective ない in its く-stem form with the verb なる attached. And in this case it is in the past tense. The second instance is not in any sense in the negative. I'm not sure why you thought it was. 食べたくなかったけど  = (I) was not in a state of wanting to eat but. 食べたくなった = (I) became in a state of wanting to eat. The adjective is たい and its helper verb is なる(become) in the past tense.
>
> Once again this is the negative helper adjective ない in its く-stem form. お理由もな is the adverbial form, so it means "without any reason (verb)".
>
> If you want to learn more about adjective stems, please see this video: https://youtu.be/uoj5l8-Ppws

@CureDolly (on "someone left the window open"):

> The main difference between Japanese and English here is that in てある constructions the central actor is the window that was left open, not the person who left it open. English always wants to bring the human actor back into the sentence if it can. There are many expressions like this in Japanese hat aren't really translatable into English at except by falsifying them by turning  them passive. There is no passive in Japanese.
>
> More about this phenomenon here: https://youtu.be/wLrK_YxdPoM

@Betadel:

> Going back to the 3 types of Japanese sentences: A does B, A is B (だ), A is B (い). Would you say the sentence 窓が開いている is an A is B sentence, or an A does B sentence? It seems to me like it can't be A is B because there's no adjectival function going on here, even though it seems like it in English... So, if it really is A does B, would the meaning be something like "the window exists in a state of being opened", or am I all wrong?

@CureDolly (replying to @Betadel):

> You are entirely right. Nothing that ends in a verb is ever anything but an A-does-B sentence. It is important to understand that Japanese very often regards as "actions" what English regards as "states". It is best to ignore what it would be in English and just look at what it is in Japanese. That's what you did and got it right. On the states/actions question, see this video: https://youtu.be/wLrK_YxdPoM
