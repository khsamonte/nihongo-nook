### On Kanji

@axelkeuchel5728:

> "On my path to learning Japanese, I found out that it is essential to use Kanji as soon as possible. Japanese is strongly linked to its writing system, so if you won‘t learn Kanji you won‘t learn Japanese. It‘s quite simple. So, I think it‘s the right decision to use Kanji (with some Furigana) in this course."

Cure Dolly:

> You are absolutely right about kanji. They are absolutely core to the language. New learners tend to think of them as "a strange way of writing" as if they were just an eccentric choice of orthography that might have been made differently without changing anything much, but the truth is that Japanese people "think in kanji" and we have to as well if we are going to think in Japanese. Once we start getting used to them they become our best friends.

> I have heard the argument "people were speaking Japanese before kanji were imported from China, so they aren't structurally part of the language". My answer to that is simply "read Beowulf". [Here's](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43521/beowulf-old-english-version) a handy link.

> It's silly answer in a way because unless you have been specially trained, you can't read Beowulf. But it is written in English. But English has changed so much, imported so much from Latin, French and other languages (half its vocabulary is French/Latin) that Beowulf is actually harder to read than some modern European languages. This is the relationship that pre-Chinese-influence Japanese is likely to have had to the stages of Japanese we know. The Japanese we know is so closely bound up with its kanji that they are close to the very core of the language.
