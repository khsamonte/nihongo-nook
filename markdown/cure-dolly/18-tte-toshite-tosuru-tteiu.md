こんにちは.

Today, we're going to talk about "trying to do something" and from there we're going to broaden out into the wider meanings of the "と" quotation particle because this is a very central part of Japanese that's used all the time. So we need to get a firm understanding of what it is and how it works.

Now, last week, we learned the volitional helper うand よう which makes a word end with the sound "おう" or "よう" and expresses will. If we're "trying" to do something we use the volitional for this.

So if we say, "山に登ろうとする", this means "try to climb mountain". Why does it mean that? What's this construction actually doing?

```
山に登ろうとする*
```

*に rather than を is normal here because we are climbing to the _target_ of the summit.

Well, "登ろう" expresses the will to climb.

```
しようとする = しよう (volition) + する (action) = ability not implied
```

If we say "山に登ろう", we're saying, "Let's climb the mountain". Literally, set our will toward climbing the mountain.

---

### おうとする・とする

"登ろうとする" means doing the act implied by setting our will to climb the mountain. If we just wanted to say "climb the mountain", we'd just say, "山に登る". But we're not saying "climb the mountain", we're saying "try to climb the mountain". Therefore, do the action implied in setting our will / enact our will to climb the mountain, whether we succeed in actually climbing it or not.

Some people find the distinction between "try climbing" and "try to climb" confusing. And that's really only because of the way it's expressed in English.

```
"まずは(zeroが)下を見てみた。"

・まずは：first of all
・(zeroが)：Alice
・下を：down
・見て：look-
・みた：tried*
```

*No doubt that she _could_ look down, only whether she would see anything.

In Japanese, as we learned recently (Lesson 16), if we want to say, "try climbing the mountain", we say, "山に登ってみる". The difference is that "try climbing / try eating / try swimming" doesn't imply any doubt about the fact that we can actually do it. It implies doubt about what would be the result when we've done it.

"Try eating" - we know we can eat, but don't know if we'll like it. "Try eating" - "食べてみる" - means "eat and see". Eat it and then see what the result is, see if you like it, see if you don't like it.

"山に登ってみる" means "climb the mountain and see". See whether it was hard, see what the view's like from the top.

"ケーキを食べようとする" - "try to eat the cake" - implies that we don't know whether you can in fact eat the cake or not, but try it anyway. Maybe it's a huge cake and it would be very hard to eat it all.

So "してみる" - "do and see" - implies that there's no doubt about the fact that we can do it, but there is some doubt about what the result of having done it is going to be. Are we going to like it? Is the building going to fall down? We don't know what will happen when we've done it, but we know we can do it.

"しようとする" implies that we don't know whether we can do it or not, but we are going to try to do it.

So, an important thing here is to see what the と-particle is doing. 〜と is encapsulating the sentence that came before it: "山に登ろう" - will to climb the mountain. It isn't quoting it. It's not something we've said; it's not something we've thought, exactly.

The point is that it's taking the essence, the meaning, the import of that "山に登ろう" and putting it into action. And we're going to find that in other cases.

```
ホッとする。

Enact (する)
what is
expressed (と)
in the
"sound effect" (ホッ)
```

For example, we may read that someone "ホッとした" . Now, what does that mean?

"ホッ" is in fact a sound effect. It's the sound effect of breathing a sigh of relief: "ホッ". But "ホッとする" actually does not mean "breathe a sigh of relief". What it means is, "feel relief / be relieved".

So what we're doing here is enacting the idea, the feeling, expressed in "ホッ", the sigh of relief. Just as in "山に登ろうとする" we're enacting the feeling, the import of setting our will toward climbing the mountain, that is, trying to climb it.

#### とする・にする

Now, similarly, if we say "さくらを日本人とする", it means regarding Sakura as a Japanese person.

```
"(zeroが)さくらを日本人とする。"

・(zeroが)：we
・さくらを：Sakura
・日本人と：Japanese person
・する：do

Lit: We Sakura "Japanese person" enact.
Trans: We assume/take Sakura to be Japanese.

・と in place of だ here because "supposing" rather than "being" is taking place.
```

Now, we might also say, "さくらを日本人にする", but that means something quite different.

It means "turn Sakura into a Japanese person".

〜に is the target of an action.

A little while ago we had a lesson (Lesson 8) in which we talked about "さくらがかえるになる" - "Sakura becomes a frog".

```
"さくらは(zeroが)かえるになった。"

・さくらは：Sakura-topic
・(zeroが)：she
・かえるに：frog-to
・なった：become
```

Now, we've also talked about the way that "ある" and "する" are the Eve and Adam of Japanese verbs, "ある" being the primary self-move verb and "する" the primary other-move verb.

"なる" is very closely related to "ある" - "ある" is "be", "なる" is "become".

And so if we say "〜になる" it means to become something.

If we say "〜にする" that's the other-move version of "〜になる".

It means to "turn something into something".

So if we say, "魔女がさくらをかえるにした" - "the witch turned Sakura into a frog".

```
"魔女がさくらをかえるにした。"

・魔女が：witch
・さくらを：Sakura
・かえるに：frog-into
・した：did

・にした：turned
```

"さくらを日本人にする" - turning Sakura into a Japanese person; but "さくらを日本人とする" - regarding Sakura as a Japanese person / taking Sakura as a Japanese person.

```
"(zeroが)さくらを日本人とする。"

・(zeroが)：We
・さくらを：Sakura
・日本人と：Japanese person
・する：do

Lit: We Sakura "Japanese person" enact.
Trans: We assume/take Sakura to be Japanese.

・と in place of だ here because "supposing" rather than "being" is taking place.
```

"かばんを・枕と・する."

"かばん" is "bag", "枕" is "pillow" and this means "using your bag as a pillow".

You're not turning your bag into a pillow, it's not becoming a pillow, but you're regarding it as one and using it as one.

So here we have some of the uses of "〜とする".

Generally speaking, it relates to how we regard something.

### として

Now, if we say "〜として", this isn't so much the act of regarding something as something, but seeing something in the light of being something. So, in English it would usually be translated simply as "as".

So, "個人としての意見" means "my opinion as a private person", as opposed to, say, "my opinion as president of the Frog Jockey Society."

Or we could say, "アメリカ人として小さい" - "She's small for an American / As an American, she's small. So we can see that the quotation function of 〜と is used not only to quote ideas and thoughts, but also to take the feeling of something and bundle it up and then say something about it.

@Cure Dolly: 

> I think とする in itself should be clear.
>
> With として, we could say that it means "as" or "for" in the senses I gave: "she is big _for_ an American", "she came _as_ a representative for the Frog Jockey Society." So we can see it as meaning "taken as", "regarded as", "in the role of", etc. What is the logic of this? I think we can put it this way: with とする, we have an action a completed verb. We are usually saying that we とする _something_.
>
> But として uses the connective て-form - it is not a complete action in itself, it is leading to something else. The point of such a sentence in general won't be the fact that we are taking something or using something as something. It will be to pinpoint the role in which we are looking at someone or something as a piece of supplementary information to the real point.
>
> So with アメリカ人として小さい, the point, the action, of the sentence isn't that I am regarding her as an American. That is just setting the context for what I want to say - that she is small (in that context, taken in that way). Does this help?

### と言う・という

Of course, the most basic thing that can follow 〜と is "いう", in which case it's a literal quotation, 〜という (it's usually pronounced not so much "-to iu" as "-to yu"). And this again can be used not just in a literal quotation but also saying how something is said or what it's called.

So, "不思議の国のアリスという本", means "book called Fushigi-no kuni-no Arisu".

```
という is usually written in Kana when it precedes (modifies) anything.
```

#### っていう・って言う

And the 〜と in "〜と言う" can be reduced simply to 〜って. So we can say "〜っていう" - "不思議の国のアリスっていう本", or it can be reduced down to just 〜って.

"不思議の国のアリスって本" still means "The book called Alice in Wonderland".

So, people sometimes get a little confused when they just see this って. It means 〜と or 〜という, but the thing that really confuses people sometimes is that it can also be used in place of the は-particle.

#### って used in place of は

Now, this seems particularly strange, until you realize what it's actually doing. If we remember what the は-particle is, the は-particle is the topic-marking particle.

So when we say "さくらは日本人だ", we can put that into English as "Speaking of Sakura, she is Japanese person". Now, does that start to make things a little clearer?

```
"さくらは(zeroが)日本人だ。"
・さくらは：Sakura (topic)
・(zeroが)：she
・日本人だ：Japanese person-is

"さくらって(zeroが)日本人だ。"
・さくらって：Sakura-say (i.e. make-topic)
・(zeroが)：she
・日本人だ：Japanese person-is
```

"さくらって(zeroが)日本人だ" - "Sakura-say, (she) Japanese-person is" - "Sakura-speaking of, (she) Japanese-person is" - "Sakura (topic), (she) Japanese-person is".

Now, we can't say 〜と or 〜と言う in place of the は-particle. It's a very casual use.

We just use 〜って.

But you can see that it's really, even though it's very colloquial, it's not just some random and inexplicable thing.

**It's setting up Sakura as the thing we're talking about, just as 〜は is.**

Now, there are other extended uses of 〜と. We'll cover those as we come to them.

But if you have any questions, if you'd like to ask about any of them right now, or if you have any comments to make, please put them in the comments below and I will answer as usual.

Thank you so much.

And thank you for attending this lesson.

これからもよろしくお願いします。

Class dismissed.
