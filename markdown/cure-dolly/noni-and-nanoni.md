Hello, pretty peoples. 川ジャパンのキュアドリいです.

Today we are going to talk about “のに” and “なのに”, which is often used as a sentence ender as well as a conjunction.

Last week, we talked about a group of sentence enders – “のです, “なのです”, “のだ”, “なのだ” etc. – and when you are beginning it can feel as if there are lots of different enders – “のだ”, “のです”, “なのに”, “のに” – and they all sound somewhat similar and very confusing.

But, as I showed you with the eight sentence enders we considered last week, those are all very self-explanatory, they’re all just variants on each other, and terribly easy to understand once you know what’s happening.

“のに” and “なのに” are the same – you just really need to know what’s going on and then it’s all very clear.

But the first thing to understand is that “のに” and “なのに” are NOT related to the ones we considered last week: “のです”/“なのです”.

That’s because they don’t end in “だ” or “です” and so the grammatical structure is actually quite different.

All right.

### のに

So what is “のに”?

Let’s just start with that: what is “のに”?

What it is is a conjunction and a conjunction is something that joins two clauses, each of which could be a complete sentence in itself, joins two of them together to make one compound sentence, such as: “I went to the shops and bought some bread.”

Each of those is a complete sentence in itself and the “and” joins them together into a complex sentence, doesn’t it?

Now, what “のに” is is what’s called a “逆説 (ぎゃくせつ)” and that’s an opposing conjunction.

The main “逆説” in English is “but”: “I went to the shops but there was no bread.”

We use “but” when the second clause of the two somehow contradicts or stands in opposition to the first.

The “逆説” that you probably know already is ‘けど” – or perhaps the more formal “が” (And the “が” which is a “逆説” is the only other “が” is Japanese apart from the all-important が-particle– and work very differently so they are not confusable.)

So, “お店に行ったがパンがなかった” – “I went to the shops, but there was no bread.”

“のに” is a little different from those because it tends to imply – it’s not a hard-and-fast rule, but it very much tends to imply that the second of the two clauses is unsatisfactory and very often personally disappointing to the speaker.

“パンがおいしいのにお客さんが来ない。” – “Even though the bread is delicious, the customers don’t come.”

So, how does this conjunction become a sentence ender?

The answer to that is that strictly grammatically-speaking it doesn’t.

But you are going to see it ending a lot of sentences – casual sentences, that is.

So, what’s going on here?

Well, as we see, a conjunction needs to join two complete sentences.

So before you have a conjunction you’ve got to have a complete sentence.

You then add the conjunction to join it to something else.

But sometimes in Japanese that “something else”, that second part, never comes.

And to understand that you have to understand that the Japanese people are very fond of trailing statements – statements that leave the conclusion unstated.

And this is why you will often find in casual speech, or in manga, anime, novels – in casual speech – you will often see sentences that end with the te-form.

Now, grammatically you can’t end the sentence with the te-form.

It’s a conjunctive form.

It implies that something else is coming.

But it’s often done.

Let’s take an example: “赤ちゃんがうるさくて”.

What does that mean?

Well, the actual sentence is “赤ちゃんがうるさい” or “うるさかった” – “The baby is (or was) noisy.”

But then we’re ending with the conjunctive te-form “うるさくて” – “The baby is (or was) noisy and...”

We don’t know whether it is or was noisy because the tense-marker would have come at the end of the complete sentence, which hasn’t been completed.

So what does this mean?

What it means depends on the context – and the listener will know the context.

So it might mean: "The baby was noisy and so I couldn’t sleep” or it might mean “The baby was noisy and it was embarrassing in front of all those people.”

But this kind of unfinished, trailing statement is very very common.

So let’s look at a “のに” statement.

We might be, say, at some venue waiting for Sakura to arrive and someone might remark, “さくらが約束したのに” and that means “Even though Sakura promised.”

The sentence is obviously simply “Sakura promised” but what she is in fact saying is “Even though Sakura promised to come, she hasn’t,” and that “のに” implies the rest of the sentence.

All right.

### なのに

So what about “なのに”?

Why do sentences end in “なのに”?

The reason for that is that where we use の we have to use the conjunctive form of the “だ” or “です”.

So when that first complete sentence, the one that takes the conjunction, ends in だ, we have to change it to な in order to put a の after it.

So, to take an example: “晴れた日曜日なのに.”

And what does that mean?

Well, the basic sentence is simply “晴れた日曜日だ” and that means “Øが晴れた日曜日だ” – “It is a sunny Sunday.”

Literally, “It is a day that became and still is sunny.”

“It (today) is a sunny Sunday.”

Now, if you want a “のに” on the end we have to turn that “だ” into a “な”, so “晴れた日曜日なのに.”

And when would we say that?

Well, suppose we are sick in bed and it’s a beautiful Sunday, and you say “晴れた日曜日なのに.”

What you are in fact saying is “It’s a sunny Sunday but unfortunately...”

But that doesn’t amount to much in English, does it?

What you’re really saying is something like “It’s a beautiful sunny Sunday and I could have gone out for a lovely picnic but I can’t, because I’m here in bed.”

Now that’s an awful lot that’s been left out, isn’t it, and that’s why people say things like “Well, Japanese people don’t say all that they’re thinking” – and of course, they don’t, but it’s also why Japanese is such an economical language.

“晴れた日曜日なのに” means all of that so long as you know the context – and sitting in a room talking to someone they do know the context – all you need is “晴れた日曜日なのに” to say that whole thing: “It’s a beautiful sunny Sunday and I could have gone for a picnic but I can’t, because I’m here in bed.”
