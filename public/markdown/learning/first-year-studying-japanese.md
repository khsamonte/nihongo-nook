## Background

Hi. I'm a 30 year-old full-time programmer from the Philippines and I started studying Japanese exactly one year ago (April 30th, 2023) when I attended my first online class in Japanese Language Research Center. Prior to that, I had been learning on Duolingo at a very relaxed pace, so I knew how to read Hiragana (and Katakana). I work 9 hours a day, 5 days a week, and spend 2.5 hours on commuting daily.

## Timeline

### Japanese Classes

During my first five months, my studies primarily consisted of:

+ ・N5 classes on the weekends (3 hours on Sat/Sun)
+ ・Vocabulary + grammar drills on my free time
+ ・Rote Kanji writing

This was my regular routine for the whole duration of my N5 classes. I was happy with my learning pace. I began to feel the difficulties of Japanese when we started learning about the plain form of the verbs (ru, nai, ta, nakatta) halfway through the course. I remember thinking, "Life was so easy with the -masu forms, why am I suddenly bombed with this info overload?!"

When we were given our first Listening Quiz, which only started around August (the 4th month of the class), I didn't understand a single thing. This admittedly made a dent to my morale and humbled me down really fast. I was confident with my basic reading skills, but my listening skills were nil. I started easing in some listening reviews to my studies, but it was very difficult to comprehend everything the first time.

Overall, I was satisfied with this class, and I became good friends with some of my classmates. Although the downside to it is that it'll take a very long time to learn the language at the pace we were going, the classes were very fun and friendly to keep us motivated.

When our classes ended on September, I immediately enrolled for N4 classes (even though my N5 exam was still in December). The grammar lessons were relatively easy, but I felt a steep curve in difficulty with the reading exercises. Almost always, whenever we were having reading quizzes and exams, I was last to finish amongst the class. Everyone else was significantly faster than me.

Because of this, I dreaded the reading comprehension tests. It felt like sludging through uninteresting material, primarily because majority of the vocabulary went over my head. To compensate for this, I adapted stricter vocabulary and Kanji drills. While I do think that my N4 classes were ultimately futile, it gave me a solid idea on how I would like to further proceed with my studies.

### JLPT N5

I took my JLPT N5 exam on December 3rd, 2023 and attained the following scores:

+ ・Total Score: 110 / 180 (61.1%)
+ ・Vocabulary/Grammar + Reading: 79 / 120 (65.8%)
+ ・Listening: 31 / 60 (51.7%)
+ ・Percentile Rank: 80.5

### Immersion

At the start of 2024, I began learning about immersion and comprehensible input (i+1). I became aware of AJATT (All Japanese All The Time) methods, which discarded traditional textbook-learning and endorsed single-handedly relying on immersion (i.e. reading and listening to Japanese content) to learn a language (paired with building your own flashcard deck on Anki, which utilizes SRS).

I was lucky that my favorite anime, Bunny Girl Senpai, is heavily dialogue-driven (the episodes consist of 95% conversations). I began manually transcribing the Japanese subtitles from Netflix straight to Google Docs, analyzing every single sentence, and adding all the vocab I didn't know to my flashcard deck. I extracted and trimmed the audio using Audacity, transfered the audio file to my phone, and repeatedly listened to it over and over and over (at least 30 times and counting).

This was a game-changer for me. This specific method single-handedly enhanced my listening comprehension 10x. I love transcribing in general; it's the kind of labor I'm willing to spend hours and hours (whole weekends) on. Then I did the exact same thing for the 2nd Episode of Bunny Girl Senpai. My daily 2.5 hours of commute was primarily spent on listening to these audio files. Before I sleep, I would also listen with my eyes closed until I finally feel sleepy.

After doing this for two episodes, I was suddenly _quite_ comfortable with indulging on Japanese content (with Japanese subtitles) virtually everywhere else (anime, YouTube, etc.). Of course, I still didn't fully understand the content I was watching, but I had a rough idea of what was going on most of the time. This is the first time I understood the sweet spot of immersing in i+1 content. I devoured as many Japanese media as I could.

> Side Note: I was late to discover Language Reactor, which gives you the power to export entire Japanese transcripts from Netflix and YouTube. Also, it's a tool that allows you to check definitions of words on the subtitles as you watch through Japanese shows. This tool has been invaluable to my learning.

My point is - this was a tremendous source of enjoyment for me, and I strongly believe that the best way to learn a language is to have fun with how you learn, no matter how personalized your methods are.

Here's an interesting realization: as someone who voraciously reads English content, reading Japanese content presently bores me to no end. 

## Present

Current routine:

+ Finishing my daily Anki flashcards in the morning
+ Listening immersion during 2.5 hours of commute
+ 

Rating my skills:

+ １）Listening: A2 level
+ ２）Reading: A2 level
+ ３）Writing (typing): A1 level
+ ４）Speaking: Elementary

## Resources
+ 

## Takeaways
+ There is such a thing as over-reliance on using Google Translate.
+ You don't always have to immerse in material with comprehensible input (i+1). Sometimes, you can listen to something way more advance than your current level. The important thing is you are _enjoying the material_ enough for you to listen to it over and over and over.
