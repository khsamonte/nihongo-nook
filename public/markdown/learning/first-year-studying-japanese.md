##### Ken Samonte | April 30, 2024

## Background

Hi. I'm a 30-year-old full-time programmer from the Philippines. I started studying Japanese exactly one year ago, on April 30th, 2023, when I attended my first online class in a language school. Prior to that, I had been learning on Duolingo at a very relaxed pace, so I knew how to read Hiragana and Katakana. I am presently bilingual with Tagalog as my native language (NL) and a C1 Level of proficiency in English.

The phonetics of Japanese and Tagalog are very similar since they are both _syllable-timed_ languages, whereas English is a _stress-timed_ language, so its pronunciation was much easier to digest for me. 

## Timeline

### Japanese Classes

During my first five months, my studies primarily consisted of:

+ ・N5 classes on the weekends (3 hours on Sat/Sun)
+ ・Vocabulary + grammar drills in my free time
+ ・Rote Kanji writing
+ ・Translation drills

This was my standard routine for the whole duration of my N5 classes. I was happy with my learning pace.

When we were given our first Listening Quiz, which only started around the third month of the class, I didn't understand a single thing. This admittedly made a dent in my morale and humbled me down quickly. I was confident with my basic reading skills, but my listening comprehension was nil. I started easing in some listening reviews to my studies, but it was very difficult to comprehend everything the first time. Overall, I was satisfied with this class, and I even became good friends with some of my classmates.

When our classes ended in September, I immediately enrolled for N4 classes (even though my N5 exam was still in December). The grammar lessons were relatively easy, but I had a much harder time with the reading exercises. Almost always, whenever we were having reading quizzes and exams, I was last to finish amongst the class. Everyone else was significantly faster than me.

Because of this, I dreaded the reading comprehension tests. It felt like sludging through boring material, primarily because the majority of the vocab went over my head. I once scored 2/7 on a reading test after giving it my all, and while that was quite demoralizing, my tolerance for failure is thankfully pretty good. To compensate for this, I adapted stricter vocabulary and Kanji drills.

### JLPT N5

I took my [JLPT](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/index.html) N5 exam on December 3rd and attained the following scores:

+ ・Total Score: 110 / 180 (61.1%)
+ ・Vocabulary/Grammar + Reading: 79 / 120 (65.8%)
+ ・Listening: 31 / 60 (51.7%)
+ ・Percentile Rank: 80.5

(I understand that some people think the JLPT is a waste of time, i.e., one's proficiency is hardly defined by tests with flawed designs. Nonetheless, there is a sense of fulfillment and anticipation in these tests, and that is enough for me.)

### Immersion

At the start of 2024, I started hearing about [immersion](https://refold.la/simplified/stage-0/a/what-is-immersion) and [comprehensible input](https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html) ([i+1](https://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash-english.html)). I became aware of [AJATT (All Japanese All The Time)](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html) methods, which discarded traditional textbook learning and endorsed single-handedly relying on intensive immersion to learn a language, paired with building your own flashcard deck on [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), which utilizes spaced repetition.

However, I don't subscribe to their extreme methods because they require a good amount of linguistic intuition which I don't have, and I am fully aware that the level of intensity they demand will burn me out. I also believe that textbooks are also helpful to an extent.

My listening practice started with [The Bite Size Japanese Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/58H68tM3uC2JNZI4hXvdeu) on the recommendation of my girlfriend. Her content is really good for beginners as she speaks slowly and reiterates words while delving into relatable everyday topics. I spent weeks listening to her while walking and taking the train on my way home from work every day. I would say that レイラさん helped me dip my toes in listening comprehension.

I was lucky that my favorite anime of all time, [Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37450/Seishun_Buta_Yarou_wa_Bunny_Girl_Senpai_no_Yume_wo_Minai), is heavily dialogue-driven (the episodes consist of 95% conversations). I began manually transcribing the Japanese subtitles from Netflix straight to Google Docs, analyzing every single sentence and adding all the vocab I didn't know to my flashcard deck. I extracted and trimmed the audio using Audacity, transferred the audio file to my phone, and repeatedly listened to it over and over and over (at least 20 times and counting).

This was a game-changer for me. This specific method enhanced my listening comprehension x10. I love transcribing in general; it's the kind of labor I'm willing to grind hours and hours (whole weekends) on. Then I did the exact same thing for the 2nd Episode of Bunny Girl Senpai. My daily 2.5 hours of commute was primarily spent listening to these audio files. Before I sleep, I would also listen with my eyes closed until I finally feel sleepy.

After doing this for two episodes, I was suddenly _quite_ comfortable with indulging in Japanese content (with Japanese subtitles) virtually everywhere else (anime, YouTube, etc.). Of course, I still didn't fully understand the content I was watching, but I had a rough idea of what was going on a lot of times. This is the first time I understood the sweet spot of immersing in i+1 content (comprehensible input). I devoured as many Japanese media as I could. Some of my favorites are: [あかね的日本語教室](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh-GhnQ7qDQmS6Bz3pGc1Mw), [Speak Japanese Naturally](https://www.youtube.com/@SpeakJapaneseNaturally), and [Daily Japanese with Naoko](https://www.youtube.com/@DailyJapanese).

> Side note: I was late to discover [Language Reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/), a browser extension that gives you the power to export entire Japanese transcripts from Netflix and YouTube (including auto-generated subs). Also, it's a tool that allows you to check definitions of words on the subtitles as you watch Japanese shows. This tool has been invaluable to my learning.

Moreover, reading the transcripts was made easy with the existence of pop-up web browser dictionaries like [Yomitan (PC)](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan) and [10ten (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/10ten-japanese-reader/id1573540634). Having the audio available for these transcripts facilitates reading comprehension. I also wrote Python scripts to automate raw transcript formatting (to my personal liking) and hosted an unindexed site using markdown to easily access my transcripts wherever I was with the pop-up dictionaries I was using.

I combined Intensive, Free-Flow, and Passive Immersion methods into one. Here is my current process:

Free-Flow Immersion:

+ １）Watch a whole anime episode/YouTube video with Japanese subtitles with minimal to no pauses.

Active Immersion:

+ ２）In particularly interesting episodes/videos, strip the audio via torrent or converters, trim out the unnecessary parts using [audio software](https://www.audacityteam.org/), and transfer the refined audio file to a phone.
+ ３）Generate the transcript from the subtitles using [Language Reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/).
+ ４）Study each line and sentence intensively by looking up the definition of each new word and try to make sense of the sentence from its context.
+ ５）Add one flashcard to the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) Japanese deck for every new unknown word that I find useful to learn.

Passive Immersion: 

+ ６）Listen and re-listen to the audio as many times as possible.
+ ７）Read and re-read the transcript as many times as possible.
+ ８）Simultaneously do 6 and 7 occasionally.

This method is definitely not going to be effective for everyone in the same way some of AJATT's methods did not work for me. But this process works for me because 1) I enjoy the whole laborious process and 2) I have a _very low_ tolerance for ambiguity (i.e., I prefer to fully understand all the vocab and grammar in a transcript).

I cannot emphasize this enough: my methods are very personal to me, and this is what I find highly effective to do continuously and consistently. If you have a rough idea of how you would like to proceed with your study methods, whether they be Duolingo, language school, AJATT, Kanji writing, etc., I highly encourage you to do that and follow your heart.

My point is - my immersion methods bring me a tremendous amount of joy, and I strongly believe that the best way to learn a language is to have fun with how you learn, no matter how personalized your methods are. It's okay if you don't know yet which works for you - it took me a whole year to figure this out after soaking up countless articles on the internet. 

## Active Study

### Cure Dolly's Organic Japanese

I discovered [Organic Japanese with Cure Dolly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XpuXerkGU8waJ4DPDNJA4bGeqOvM-csXjTe57iHARHc/edit), which is arguably the best online lesson structure existing to get a crystal-clear understanding of Japanese grammatical foundations. I tried [Tae Kim's Guide](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/) but I find Cure Dolly to be far more effective. The reason for this is that she teaches Japanese grammar and its nuances in the context of Japanese. (For instance, some school textbooks were obviously written in the context of English (and even Filipino) subtleties.)

Cure Dolly's lessons, along with my daily flashcard reps, serve only as a supplemental aid to my immersion, which is my primary method of study.

### Graded Readers / Children's Content

For a short while, before I transitioned to immersion, I tried graded readers. It taught me a thing or two, of course, but I didn't find them interesting enough to keep continuing. I felt the same with children's shows: my mind was too impatient to deal with the simplicity, so I kept getting distracted. Attention is a _very_ crucial element in language learning, and I've decided to discard every single study method that couldn't hold my focus.

If you're after simple vocabulary, I would argue that alternatives more befitting to adults exist, such as [this video introducing kitchen items](), for instance. Several channels churning out similar content exist across YouTube.

### Anki

I just use a single deck that has all the Japanese words, phrases, and grammar patterns I want to learn. I have two types of cards:

+ １）Vocab Cards: The Kanji of the word in front. This comprises about 90% of my cards.
+ ２）Word-Highlighted Sentence Cards: For words with multiple definitions, I use sentences with the target word highlighted in front. This comprises about 10% of my cards.

This is the back template of my card:

+ ・Furigana of the vocab
+ ・Meaning of the word (English or Tagalog definition)
+ ・Sample sentence for context (no Furigana)

I treat Anki as nothing but vocab drills. With the Kanji in front, I try to guess the meaning and the reading of the word.

+ Word: 飛行機
+ Reading: ひこうき (hikōki)
+ Meaning: airport

I prefer learning the Kanji of new words straight away because knowing only the meaning and the Kana of a word feels like a sluggish way to learn new vocab to me. And since single Kanji characters can have the same readings, as your vocabulary grows, it will be easier to remember other words and their readings because some of the Kanji will already be familiar.

I should note that I have no knowledge of the _onyomi_ and _kunyomi_ classifications of Kanji readings; if this is your preferred way of learning, however, by all means go ahead. It was uncomfortable to try memorizing so much Kanji in the beginning, so I started with 10 new cards/day before gradually increasing it to 20, which is my current setting.

I use the [FSRS algorithm](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki) with a 90% retention rate and this has worked well for me. I can see myself continuing using Anki perhaps until I attain a good amount of vocab, but I think I will eventually discontinue using it (once I'm around B2 level maybe).

## Present

### Current routine:

+ ・Waking up at 7:00 AM to complete my daily Anki flashcards (30 to 45 minutes) before getting up.
+ ・Dedicating most of my free time to consuming Japanese content with the active immersion method I mentioned in a few paragraphs above.
+ ・Free-flow listening immersion during 2-2.5 hours of commute and passive listening at work (during menial tasks only).
+ ・Chatting and talking in Japanese to my girlfriend (she is N2-level). お互いから学んでいます。
* ・Studying at least one new grammar pattern a day via [Cure Dolly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XpuXerkGU8waJ4DPDNJA4bGeqOvM-csXjTe57iHARHc/edit) or [Nihongo Kyoshi JLPT Grammar](https://nihongokyoshi-net.com/jlpt-grammars/).
* ・Occasionally answering entire [JLPT Listening Sets]() without pauses to simulate test-taking environments, and also studying listening sets that are one level above me as advanced conditioning.

Stuff I no longer do:

+ ・Eliminated Kanji rote writing from my routine altogether. Writing is effective for some people - I'm just not one of them. I find mnemonics to be more effective, but I don't spend a lot of time thinking about that.

### An honest rating of my present skills:

+ １）Reading: **A2**. I can't read light novels smoothly yet, but I am comfortable with reading extensive passages in N4-level reading comprehension tests.
+ ２）Listening: **A2**. I can understand what's going on most of the time in simple conversations and monologues, but I might miss some of the vocab occasionally.
+ ３）Writing (typing): **A2**. I can hold a conversation with my girlfriend with a bit of mental effort. I may be able to write a letter to a friend.
+ ４）Speaking: **A1**. It takes me a long while to form simple, descriptive sentences.

## Takeaways

These are the things I would tell myself a year ago.

・Language schools can give you a solid framework on how to start and continue with your studies, and a hundred hours of language school grants you a Student Visa eligibility (in my country at least), but its pedagogical efficacy differs from person to person. The possibility of losing motivation after attaining low scores in tests, vocab drills without sentence context, and the number of students in a class can all play as factors in diminishing their efficacy. However, they are a rich source of learning material and resources for your own studies. Ultimately, language schools are merely _supplemental_ to my main learning methods.

・Learn Japanese the Japanese way and don't translate everything you read to English in your head. Translation drills can lead to unnatural sentence structures. Also, there is such a thing as over-reliance on Google Translate. I highly recommend trying to analyze more complex sentences on your own first, with Google Translate only serving as a last resort.

・Aside from obvious nouns like "dog" and "vending machine", Japanese words have a life of their own and cannot be completely defined by their closest English translation. The word 面白い (omoshiroi) means "funny", but it also means "interesting". Some words don't even have direct translations; they can only be grasped by the context in which they are used.

・You don't always have to immerse in material with comprehensible input (i+1). Sometimes, you can listen to something way more challenging than your current level. The important thing is you are _thoroughly enjoying the material_ enough for you to listen to it over and over and over.

・Output is important, but output can wait. I believe there is some truth in getting enough input first before starting your output. I only started immersion less than four months ago, but when I'm practicing speaking at my current level, the words are beginning to come out much more naturally than ever.

・This point will be fringe and inarticulate, so take it with a grain of salt. Some people will be much better at output at a much earlier stage, but I like to think they're exceptionally talented. My patterns of output are much more "emulative" than they are "creative" in that, my speaking feels way more natural when I "imitiate" other people's speaking rather than creating sentences in my own mind before saying them. I feel the exact same way with English, which is why my speaking output came much later than my writing output.

・I initially thought I would never attain my current level of fluency in English. I thought of myself as an eloquent writer during my formative years, but my pieces were quite unnatural (since I hardly spoke the language). I learned how to write much more organically by speaking a lot more - it's true when they say that anybody who could talk could also write.

・Technology has immensely facilitated the study of languages, and we are very fortunate to be living in modern times. Take the time to learn how to use them as early as possible. 

## Future Plans

・**Start reading novels.** As someone who voraciously reads English content and heavily prefers ebooks over audiobooks, reading Japanese content presently bores me. I am not as enthusiastic when it comes to reading materials as I am when listening to audio material while reading the transcript/subtitles, but I cannot deny the effectiveness and importance of reading. For my second year, I plan to indulge in light novels from start to finish and then listen to their respective audiobooks repeatedly.

・**Watch native-level Japanese content without Japanese subtitles.** Native-level Japanese dialogue without the aid of Japanese subtitles is a different behemoth in itself. As someone who's dependent on English subtitles when watching English media, this will probably be the most difficult aspect of input.

・**Integrate output to my everyday life.** I will probably start writing Japanese essays every day for a few months, but I'm still figuring out a sustainable approach. I will post about my methods next year once I figure them out.

・**Study Kansai dialect.** My girlfriend currently lives in the Kansai Region, so the specific domain of Kansai dialect is one of our top choices among other language specializations. Moreover, I think only a small minority of Japanese learners pay attention to the Kansai dialect.

・**My ultimate goal is C1 level: conversational fluency and university-level literacy.** I have no delusions that it will take me a very long time to attain this - five years or more, at the very least. It may even take me an entire lifetime. Language learning is tough, but I am pleased with my current progress.
