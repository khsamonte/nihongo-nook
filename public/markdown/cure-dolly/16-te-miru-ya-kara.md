こんにちは。

Today we're going back to Alice, and we're going to be using quite a lot of trains this time because I want us to really grasp the structure of these sentences.

So, if you remember from last time, Alice had just entered the rabbit hole and quite surprisingly she finds herself falling very slowly down a vertical hole.

```
"落ちる間に暇がたっぷりあって周りをゆっくり見回せた。"
```

Now, I'm going to tell you what this means first and then we're going to break it down.

"落ちる間に"

"落ちる", as we know, is "fall". "間" is a period of time and it's also the space between two things.

And obviously a period of time is always, metaphorically speaking - and we can only really talk about time in spatial metaphors - a period of time is always a space between two points, isn't it? It has a beginning and it has an end. 

So "落ちる間に" means "while (she) was falling / during the period of time while (she) was falling".

"暇" means "free time / open time". It's a word you'll see quite often, and it can be used in both a positive or a negative sense. It can mean free time to do what you want to do, or it can mean empty time, being bored, having time hanging on your hands. 

Here, it just means having plenty of time available to look around, because she's falling and she can't do anything else and she's falling rather slowly.

"たっぷり" means "in large quantities".

It's another one of these り-ending adverbs that don't need に. And it means "in large quantities / in plentiful amounts" - rather like pouring from a tap: "たっぷり", "in large quantities". 

And here, it's an adverb describing the fact that the "暇", the "free time", exists. 
So the free time exists in large quantities.

```
落ちる・間に・暇が・たっぷり・あって

・落ちる：fall- (verb working as an adjective for 間)
・間に：during
・暇が：free time
・たっぷり：plentifully (adverbial noun not needing に)
・あって：existed-and-
```

So that's our first logical clause:  "落ちる間に…" (which simply sets the scene, the time, for the action - it's an absolute time expression because it's a particular time, so it takes に)

"...暇がたっぷりあって" ("there was a lot of free time").

Now, the next part - "周りをゆっくり見まわせた" - is interesting because this is another example of what we were talking about last week: self-move/other-move pairs.

"回る" means to "go around/move around". 

The rather childish name for a policeman is "お回りさん", which means "someone who goes around / someone who does the rounds".

"回す" means "make (something) go around / to send (something) around / to cause it to go around" and of course, as we learned last week, we easily know which of the pair is the self-move word (going around) and which is the other-move word (sending around) because the sending-around one ends in -す.

Now, we don't actually have "回る" here; we have "まわり". And as we've mentioned before, when we take the い-stem of a verb and use it on its own it usually becomes a noun. There is another use which we're not going to enter into right now, but in this case, it is becoming a noun.

So, what does "まわり" mean?

"まわり" can actually mean two things: 

It can be the noun-form of "回る", in which case it's "going around", "doing the rounds", and that's what we have in "お回りさん", a policeman - here's someone who does the act of doing the rounds. "回り" is "the act of doing the rounds", 

But it can also mean "the surroundings", and in this case it actually takes a different kanji to show that it's a slightly different meaning of the word. Note: It’s this Kanji - 周り.

It's still the noun-form of "around", but in this case it's the surroundings, not the act of going around.

```
(zeroが)・周りを・ゆっくり・見・回せた

・(zeroが)：Alice
・周りを：surrounds
・ゆっくり：leisurely
・見：lookage- (い-stem formation)
・回せた：around-send-could (回す + potential helper + past tense*)

* with very active す-verbs, the potential actor is likely to be the human
```

So, "(zeroが)周りをゆっくり見回せた" means “(she) could in a leisurely manner…” ("ゆっくり", that adverb we learned last week - Lesson 14)... she could in a leisurely manner 見回す"

What does "見回す" mean?
 
We know what "回す" means - it means to "make (something) go around". 

"見回す" is attaching "回す" to the い-stem of "見る". 

We can't actually tell it's the い-stem, because this is an ichidan verb, and all ichidan stems look the same, as we know, but we know that this is in fact the れんようけい/連用形, the い-stem, because that's the one that gets used for attaching verbs to other verbs.

So, "見回す" means literally "send your looking around / send your eye-beams around the place / make your looking go around". 

So, "周りを見回す" is "look around the place / send your eye-beams, send your looking around the place / surroundings". 

And "見回せる" is, as we've seen, the potential form of "見まわす".　

So what this is saying is  "because a lot of time existed, she was able to leisurely send her looking around the surroundings".

"落ちる間に暇がたっぷりあって周りをゆっくり見回せた。"

---
```
"まずは、下を見てみたけど、 暗すぎて何も見えなかった。"
```

"First of all, she tried looking down, but it was too dark so nothing was visible (nothing could be seen)."

"まずは" means "first of all". "まず" is "from the start / from the beginning". 

"まずは、下を 見てみた". 

Now, "下を見る" is "looking down / looking at the down".

We know that in Japanese "down" is always a noun, don't we? So you look "at the down" - "下を見る".

But it doesn't say "見る" here; it says "見てみた". And this is a form of speech that we're going to find a great deal.

### -てみる

When we add "みる" to the て-form of another verb, what we're doing is saying "try doing something"; literally we're saying "do it and see".

So, "食べてみる" means "eat it and see / have a taste of it".　

+ A: "Do you like this?"　
+ B: "I don't know."
+ A: "食べてみてください. Try it, taste it, eat it and see."

We often say "やってみる" - "I'll give it a try / I'll try and see what happens".

"やる" is a more casual form of "する", and you can say "してみる", especially in more formal circumstances, but more often, we say:

"やってみる": "Give it a try / give it a go / do it and see."

```
まずは・(zeroが)・下を・見て・みた

・まずは：first of all
・(zeroが)：Alice
・下を：down
・見て：look-
・みた：tried (could be written 見た but more usual in kana)
```

So here we're actually using "見る" with "みる". "見てみる" 

- "try having a look / take a look / have a look and see".

So, "下を見てみたけど、暗すぎて".

"暗い" is "dark" and "すぎる", as we've talked about before, means "going by, going beyond".

So in this case "すぎる" means "too much / going in excess of".

In other words, it was too dark. It was excessively dark; it was too dark.

```
(zeroが)・暗・すぎて・何も・(zeroが)・見えなかった

・(zeroが)：it
・暗：dark
・すぎて：exceeded-and-(therefore)
・何も：even anything as-for
・(zeroが)：it
・見えなかった：did not do seeable (見る + potential helper* + past tense)

* with ordinary visibility, the potential actor is likely to be the thing seen
```

"暗すぎて何も見えなかった".

"何も" means "even as much as (something)" - "何も". 

And I've done a video on these uses of も which you might want to watch. 

"何も見えなかった" - now, "見る" is "see"; "見える" is “~~to be able to see~~ / to be visible / be seen”. 
```
Note: Might be better to translate as "to be visible / do seeable / do seen" (self-move ver. of 見る)

I added this in case there would be confusion, since it is a rather nuanced difference and people were confused about this in the comments under the video, let alone me during the first time.  

What Cure Dolly says in the comments. I recommend reading through all comments about this.

In the video, Dolly-先生 misspeaks here (as she admits in the comments), calling 見える “be able to see”, which might confuse someone to think of the potential form 見られる instead. 

In this case, she meant 見える as the self-move version of 見る, meaning something like “be visible/seeable” as physical visibility (of a thing etc.). It is a nuanced difference to 見られる. 

As Dolly says in the comments, it CAN both function as a potential and self-move version of 見る. It’s a different verb to 見られる, but 見える can also function as the irregular potential form of 見る and is also the self-moving partner to 見る. Check lesson 54 for this, even right after. 

Also, this point (if you check 見える inflections on Jisho), just like with 出来る note in Lesson 10.

The point here is that while both imply potential, there is a difference, with “be able to see” translation being more reserved to the “見られる” instead of 見える, which is more reserved to "be visible", hence why this note.

Cure Dolly's comment:

What 見える means is "do see able" meaning do the act of being able to be seen. There is no exact English equivalent of this (which needs to use passive constructions like "be visible" because it has no equivalent verb).

So 鳥が見える means literally that a bird does visible. In English we might translate it as "a bird can be seen" or "I can see a bird" but this is not what the Japanese is saying.

The first "a bird can be seen" does less violence to the Japanese because it is the bird, not the seer that is doing the action (and if we think, it is the seer that undermines our ability to understand the が-particle).

見られる is in fact very similar. The seen-thing is the actor. The main difference is that 見える usually refers to actual visibility while 見られる refers more to the opportunity to see. It is a fairly subtle distinction and not one to worry about at this stage.
```

And if we look at the trains here, 

We've got to have a が marked subject in this second clause:

"何も(zeroが)見えなかった。"

```
何も・(zeroが)・見えなかった

・何も：even anything as-for
・(zeroが)：it
・見えなかった：did not do seeable (見る + potential helper* + past tense)

* with ordinary visibility, the potential actor is likely to be the thing seen
```

What is the zero in this case? 

If we're looking at it in English terms we might think it's Alice - "Alice couldn't see anything". 

But in Japanese it will usually in fact be "何", which is "a thing / something". 

"Nothing was able to be seen, nothing could be seen",

Because usually with expressions like:

+ ・"見える / 見えない" - "be able to see / do seeable",
+ ・"聞こえる / 聞こえない" - "be able to hear / do hearable" (+ their ない-form: not hearable, etc.),

we apply it not to the person who's able to see, but to the thing that's able to be seen. 

And of course we've covered this, haven't we, in our lesson on the potential. (Lesson 10)

```
Note: The “do seeable” is a rough translation of how Dolly might translate it to show that it’s a verb more per some of her comments as noted on the previous page’s note. 

Another translation for 見える as per Dolly - to be visible/"do seen"/be seen/do seeable/visible.

While -ない, as its negative form is quite adjectival, it doesn't really matter how it’s translated, only if you wanted to be more technical as per Dolly’s way of rough translation and to more clearly show the difference between 見られる & 見える. Check lesson 54.  
```

```
その後、穴の周りを見て、目に止まるのはぎっしり並んだ戸棚や本棚だった。

その後・穴の・周りを・見て・目に・止まるのは・ぎっしり・並んだ・戸棚・や・本棚・だった。
```

"その後":

 "後", as we know, means "after" - we've had it in following after someone, but it also means "after" in the other sense, "after that". 

"その" means "that"; "その後" means "after that". 

So again, this is just a time-expression, setting it in time.

And this time it's a relative time-expression, "after that / after a particular thing", so it doesn't need に.

"その後、穴の周りを見て" 

So now she's not looking down. This means "the surroundings", again, "周り", of the hole, "をみて" - "after that, she looked at the surroundings of the hole".

```
その・後・(zeroが)・穴の・周りを・見て

・その：that
・後：after
・(zeroが)：she (Ａ)
・穴の：hole's
・周りを：surroundings-at
・見て：looked-and (Ｂ)
```

"目に止まるのはぎっしり並んだ戸棚や本棚だった。"

Right, so this is quite complex. The first clause is simple enough. 

"その後、穴の周り見て" - "After that, she looked at the surroundings of the hole".

The second clause has quite a lot for us to consider.

"目に止まるのは" means, literally, "the thing that stopped in her eye".

```
目に・止まるのは

・目に：eye-at
・止まるのは：stopped-thing-as-for
```

Now this is a similar expression to, in English, "the thing that caught her eye", isn't it?

Various things passed through her eye, passed through her vision, and the thing that stopped there was what we are going to talk about. 

But we also need to look at this use of の. As we've seen before, の is like apostrophe-s ('s) in English. 

So if we say "さくらのドレス", we're saying, "Sakura's dress". 

Now also, just as in English, if you say, "Which dress do you like best?" 

Suppose that Sakura and Mary are both wearing dresses and you say, "Which dress do you like best?"

In English you might say, "Sakura's. I like Sakura's best". You could say, "Sakura's dress" but you don't have to, you can just say, "Sakura's".

And it's the same in Japanese. 

You can say (just), "さくらの" - Sakura's, the one that belongs to Sakura. 

But this can be taken much further in Japanese, and I've done a whole video about this particular use of の, which you can look at if you want to go deeper. 

But in this case, the way it's taken further is 

"目に止まるの" - this is "the thing, the one that stopped in her eye".

"Which dress do you like best? Sakura's, Sakura's one, Sakura's thing, Sakura's dress."

"目に止まるの" - "the thing, the one that stopped in her eye".

So, "穴の周りを見て、目に止まるのは" - "looking at the surroundings of the hole, the thing that stopped in her eye was…"

And what it was, was:

```
目に・止まるのは・(zeroが)・ぎっしり・並んだ・戸棚や・本棚だった。

・目に：eye-at
・止まるのは：stopped-thing-as-for
・(zeroが)：it
・ぎっしり：closely/tightly
・並んだ：lined-up
・戸棚や：cupboards-and
・本棚だった：bookshelves-was
```

"(zeroが)ぎっしり並んだ戸棚や本棚だった。"

"ぎっしり" is yet another one of these り-ending adverbs that don't need に. 

"ぎっしり" means "tightly packed". "並んだ" is the past tense of "並ぶ" which means "lined-up", so "ぎっしり並んだ" means "tightly lined-up / packed together / lined-up and packed together".

"ぎっしり並んだ戸棚や本棚だった。"

All right. Well, we'll get to the "や" in just a moment.

"戸棚や本棚".

The word for a shelf in Japanese is "棚", and when we add something before it to tell us what kind of a shelf it is, we use that "ten-ten hooking" (〃) that we've talked about before. Note: Lesson 5, “The third & fourth Godan group”.

So the "た" becomes "だ": "戸棚" - that "と" means "door", so literally, "戸棚" is a "door-shelf"　and that is the Japanese word for a cupboard. And it's quite a good word, I think. That's what a cupboard really is, isn't it? Shelves, with a door. It's a better way of saying cupboard than the English way which says it's a board on which you put cups, which isn't quite what a cupboard is.

"本棚" is even easier: it's quite literally a book-shelf, bookshelves.

### The や particle + exclusive “and”

Now, this "や" is something we need to cover.

When you want to say "and" - something "and" something else - how do you say it in Japanese?

We know that when you're putting two clauses together, we use the て-form, or sometimes we use other things, like "でも". 

In English, we use "and" in all cases: we say "bread and butter", "pencil and paper". 

We also say "I went into the baker's and bought some bread."

But in Japanese we don't use the same "and" in the two cases. 

We already know some of the ways we can "and" two clauses together, but when we're "anding" two things together, there are two ways to do it. 

And one is to use the と-particle.

We know that the と-particle is the quotation particle, but it's also the and-particle. 

So if you want to say "pen and book", we say "ペンと本".

But we can also use the や-particle, so we can say "と" or "や" when we want to "and" together two or more objects. What's the difference?

Well, as a matter of fact it's a very useful difference, and one that we could do with in English.

"と" is an exclusive "and". If I say, "What's in that box?" and you answer "ペンと鉛筆" - "pens and pencils" - you are telling me that there are pens and pencils and nothing else in that box.

```
・ペンと鉛筆：Exclusive "and"
・ペンや鉛筆：Non-exclusive "and"
```

If you say "ペンや鉛筆", you're saying there are pens and pencils and there might also be something else - and very often you're implying that there is something else because you're avoiding using the exclusive "and".

So what "stopped in her eye" was the fact that cupboards and bookshelves (among other things) were tightly lined around the walls.

```
目に・止まるのは・(zeroが)・ぎっしり・並んだ・戸棚や・本棚だった。

・目に：eye-at
・止まるのは：stopped-thing-as-for
・(zeroが)：it：Ａ
・ぎっしり：closely/tightly
・並んだ：lined-up
・戸棚や：cupboards-and：Ｂ
・本棚だった：bookshelves-was：Ｂ
```

---

### The most basic use of the から particle

```
棚の一つから瓶を取り下ろした。
棚の・一つ・から・瓶を・取り下ろした

Note: To lower (something) can be written as 下す (おろす) or 下ろす(おろす).
下す is the irregular okurigana usage version of 下ろす. Both are fine.
```

"棚の一つ": "一つ" means "one"; "から" is a particle meaning "from". 

Now, here she's using "棚" on its own - "shelves" - and because it's not joined to anything, it's "たな" not "だな". 

And so, she is saying, "from one of the shelves"- "棚の一つから" - notice here that "棚の一つ" is really just the same as English "one of the shelves" - "棚の一つ".

```
(zeroが)・棚の・一つから・瓶を・取り・下ろした

・(zeroが)：She (Ａ)
・棚の：shelves's
・一つから：one-from
・瓶を：jar
・取り：take-
・下ろした：lowered (Ｂ)
```

Now, "取る" means "take", and "下す" - the kanji, as you can see, is the kanji for "down", and again this is part of a move-pair, self-move/other-move pair, which is why I introduced them early.

Most courses would regard that as an intermediate thing, self-move and other-move, but I think it makes it much easier to recognize what words are doing if you're aware of this.

"下りる" means "come down / step down" - come down the stairs, come off a bus. 

"下す/下ろす" means "bring (something) down". 

And once again, we know which is the other-move one - you "bring (something else) down" - that's the one that ends in -す: "下す".

So "取り下ろす" means "take and bring down".

```
・下りる：self-move
・下ろす：other-move
```

"(zeroが)棚の一つから瓶を取り下ろした."："From one of the shelves, (she) took down..."

"瓶" usually gets translated as "bottle"; in fact in this case it was more of a "jar".

What was in it? Well, we'll have to wait till next time to find out…
