Hello, pretty peoples.

KawaJapa no Kyua Dorii desu. I am Cure Dolly from KawaJapa.

Last week, we talked about the て-form and we learned how easy it is to make and to recognize once we know how it really works. Here are some of the ways that て-form is used.

I often say that Japanese is the Lego language, and what I mean by that is that it fits together very neatly. We can fit together parts of words, parts of sentences, kanji and other elements, and they all fit together in a number of very, very regular ways just like Lego. They all have the same little bumps and the same little holes that fit them.

### ている

So one of the regular Lego uses with the て-form is what's called the continuous present.

The ordinary present is "walk"; the continuous present is "be walking" – and this is just the same in Japanese. What we do in Japanese is we fit the verb "いる" onto the end of the て-form.

Now "いる" is not some strange grammatical ending – it is a regular verb that we know very well. It’s "いる": to be.

So we say "に匹の猫がいる" – there are two cats – two cats exist – two cats be. So it's very similar to English.

In English, we either walk or we can be walking.

In Japanese we either "歩く" or "歩いている".

And "いる" is simply a regular ichidan verb, so when we want to do other things with it, we just knock off that “る” and put on whatever we need. Don’t be put off by the fact that when you knock off the “る” there's just "い" left. It’s still a regular ichidan verb.

So, if we want to say was walking instead of be walking, we just put it into the た-form, as we learned last week: "いた".

"歩いていた": was walking.

If we want to put it into the negative, we just knock off the "る" and add the helper adjective "ない".

"歩いていない": not walking.

And if we want to put that "ない" into the past tense, we do it just the way we do with every い-adjective – and "ない", as I explained before is an い-adjective.

So we cut off the “い” and put on "かった".

"歩いていたなかった": was not walking.

#### Other use case of ている

Now, one thing we should notice about this form: where it does differ a little bit from English is that it can not only mean that one is in the act of doing something, but also, it can mean that one has done something and the effects of that act continue.

So, you might ask "さくらが寝ていますか？": Is Sakura sleeping?

And the answer might be "いいえ、起きている": No, she is up, she's awake.

"起きている" could mean to be in the act of getting up, if that was taking you a long time, but most often, what it means is that you have got up and you continue to be up, so you are still in a state of being up: "起きている".

### てある

There are occasions also when we use "ある" rather than "いる". When do we do this?

Well, for example we might say "窓が開いている" and that means the window is open, but we can also say "窓が開けてある" and that means also that the window is open – but it means that somebody opened it, somebody has deliberately left it open for some reason.

Is there a logic to this? Is there a reason why we use "ある" rather than "いる" in this situation?

Yes, there is a logic, and the logic is this: when we say "窓が開いている", we are treating the window almost as an honorary animate being. We are not implying that any other agent did anything to make it be open, even though in fact they probably did. We are treating it as if it were open of its own volition.

If we say "窓が開けてある", then we are putting the emphasis on the fact that somebody opened it and it's been left open for a reason. The will involved here is not the will of the window – it's the will of some other agent.

Therefore, we are very clearly and expressly treating the window as an inanimate object and therefore we give it "ある".

And that is the logic behind this distinction. In one case, we are treating the window grammatically as if it were an animate being; in the other, we are treating it grammatically as if it is an inanimate object.

One case in which we use "-てある" almost all the time is when something is written.

In English, we say "the sign said this" or "the book said that" – which is actually
rather animist in a way, isn’t it? As if the sign or the book talk.

In Japanese, we say "本に書いてある": (it) is written in the book.

Because someone else always does the writing: the writing isn't just there – it was done by somebody. We almost always say "書いてある", not "書いている".

Now, we use the て-form to make other kinds of compound verb.

A common one is made with "持つ": to carry.

You’re probably familiar with this from the "-ている" form.

Do you have a pencil?

"鉛筆が持っていますか？" – literally, are you carrying a pencil / do you have a pencil on your person?

Now we can also say "持ってくる". This means carry and come.

In English we say bring or fetch.

In Japanese we Lego together "持つ" and "くる" with the て-form to make “持ってくる”.

Similarly, "持っていく", which means the opposite of bring, doesn’t it? It means take – take it away, take it somewhere.

+ ・"持っていく": carry and go.
+ ・"持ってくる": carry and come.

#### Less literal ways of てくる・ていく

Now, we can also use these "-てくる" and "-ていく" endings in less literal ways.

For example, "雨が降ってきた". What does that mean? It literally means "雨" (rain) fall-came.

How do we say that in English? Well, we might say "It came on to rain". Or, “それが分かってきた”: that became clear.

So you see this works somewhat similarly to similar expressions in English.

And also, we often put "くる" on to the end of a verb when we're going to do it and come back.

The commonest example of that is "行ってきます", which in English is probably "I'm going out" – but in Japanese, we don't forget to say that we’re also returning.
